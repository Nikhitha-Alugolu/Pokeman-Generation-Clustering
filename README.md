Project Title: Pokémon Cluster - Pokémon Stats Clustering

Project Overview:

Pokémon Cluster is a data analysis project that utilizes clustering algorithms to group Pokémon based on their stats. The project aims to identify patterns and relationships between Pokémon stats, such as HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.

Methodology:

1. Data Collection: Gather Pokémon data from official sources or datasets
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and normalize Pokémon stats data
3. Clustering Algorithm: Apply clustering algorithms like:
    - K-Means Clustering
    - Hierarchical Clustering
    - DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
4. Cluster Evaluation: Evaluate cluster quality using metrics like Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index
5. Visualization: Visualize clusters using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
